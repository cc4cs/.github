## The CC4CS Project üëã

This project tackles the necessity of having a technology-independent performance metric. This metric can be used during the first stages of an embedded systems design methodology. The  goal of this project is to  analyze the usefulness and the  meaningfulness  of  an  innovative  performance metric that is concurrently ‚ÄúOff the Shelf‚Äù, ‚ÄúHW/SW Unifying‚Äù, and  ‚ÄúStatement  Level‚Äù. In fact, to overcome existing metrics limitations, the idea is to consider to measure the number of clock cycles needed to a specific  processor to execute a generic C statement. The proposed metric is called CC4CS (Clock Cycles for C Statement) and is defined as the ration between the number of clock cycles and the executed C statements.

$$CC4CS = \frac{ClockCycles}{ExecutedCStatements}$$
